# Microprocessor_Systems_Design

In this repository are some of the projects I completed in the Microprocessor Systems course at the University of Washington in Tacoma. 
IDEs used in this course were Code Composer Studio and Keil.
The microcontroller used in this course was the Tiva C series TM4C1294NCPDT.
